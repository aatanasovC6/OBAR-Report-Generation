Steps for OBAR Report generation 
1.	Initiation: The OBAR report process begins when a request is posted on the #chargeguard-recovery-specialists-accruals Slack channel. The request, containing a list of client names, is made by the Accrual specialist with the purpose of generating the OBAR Report.
2.	Data Extraction Status Check: Upon receiving the request, I check the notifications on the #cg-chargeguardtech-migrated Slack Channel to ensure that the data extraction for the day has been completed.
3.	Snowflake Platform Exploration: The next step involves navigating to the Snowflake Platform. Here, I assess the availability of data for the specified clients. Specifically, I examine the COOP_BACKUP_REPORT and PURCHASE_ORDER tables, which are substantial in size, containing over 70 million and 16 million records, respectively.
4.	Data Discrepancy Detection: In the case where data is present in one table but missing in the other for certain clients, I promptly communicate these findings to Muddaser through a Slack message.
5.	Code Execution with Spider Editor: After confirming the availability of data, I proceed to use the Spider Editor from the Anaconda Launcher to execute a Python code. This code, designed to run for one client at a time, connects to the Snowflake data warehouse and executes SQL code stored on my local machine.
6.	AVC Name Modification: Before running the Python code, I place the exact AVC Name of the client. The executed code generates the OBAR Report, producing a comprehensive CSV file. Additionally, it breaks down the report into 12 smaller files based on AGREEMENT_ID. Another report, named "ALL DISPUTE," is created by filtering data based on the [DISPUTE_FLAG] column with values set to "DISPUTE."
7.	Handling Large Reports: In the event that the main OBAR report exceeds 1 million rows, I access the Snowflake data warehouse platform to modify the SQL code. This modification allows for the reproduction of OBAR reports, now categorized based on the STATUS column.
8.	File Organization and Storage: Once all the generated files are on my local machine, I organize them into a folder. This folder is then placed in Google Drive under the directory "Chargeguard-Operations/Trigger: Accruals/Overbilling Accrual Reports (OBAR)."
